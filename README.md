# Infinity Scripture

## Note: the bot is currently offline
I might have accidentaly triggered the automod or something, as the bot got shadowbanned. For all I know this is temporary. Will work on after 24, probably monday.

## What is this?
Infinity-scripture is a Reddit bot that automatically quotes parts of MCU movies. At the moment the bot is limited to Infinity War.

## Usage

Using the bot is easy. When you're on /r/thanosdidnothingwrong, you can summon the bot by using the acronym of your desired movie, and the timecode for when your quote starts.

For example: `IW 4:20` will output:
```
> Let him have his fun.
- *IW	4:20*

^(I'm a bot. [Learn how to use me.](https://github.com/mevanloon/infinity-scripture))
```

If you want the bot to fetch more than one line, use a dash plus the amount lines from the srt you want, like so: `IW 5:24-2`
