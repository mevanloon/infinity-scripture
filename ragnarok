1
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,515
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:01,060
"No! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,937
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,239
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,233
It's a long story,

6
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,402
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

7
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,152
See, I spent some time on Earth...

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,657
fought some robots,

9
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,485
saved the planet a couple of times.

10
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,529
Then I went searching through the cosmos

11
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,661
for some magic, colourful
Infinity Stone things.

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,917
Didn't find any.

13
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,210
That's when I came across

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,088
a path of death and destruction...

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,043
which led me all the way here
into this cage...

16
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,311
where I met you.

17
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,849
How much longer do you think we'll be here?

18
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,495
Thor, son of Odin.

19
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,290
Surtur, son of a bitch.

20
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,492
You're still alive.

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,962
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,756
I cannot die.

23
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,674
Not until I fulfil my destiny...

24
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,128
and lay waste to your home.

25
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,762
It's funny you should mention that.

26
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,222
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

27
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,642
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

28
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,934
And you, Surtur,

29
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,637
are at the centre of all of them.

30
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,607
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

31
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,651
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.

32
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,403
Hang on.

33
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,323
I'll be back around shortly.

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,452
I really feel like we
were connecting there.

35
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,455
Okay, so Ragnarok.

36
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,329
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,459
My time has come.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,754
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

39
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,590
I shall be restored to my full might.

40
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,009
I will tower over the mountains...

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,804
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

42
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,515
Hang on. Give it a second.

43
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,849
I swear I'm not even moving.

44
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,597
It's just doing this on its own.

45
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,188
I'm really sorry.

46
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,022
Okay, so let me get this straight.

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,818
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame...

48
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,362
and then you'll suddenly grow
as big as a house?

49
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,697
A mountain!

50
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,908
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

51
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,533
Odin is not on Asgard.

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,707
And your absence has left
the throne defenceless.

53
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,709
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,834
This is my crown, the source of my power.

55
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,714
That's a crown.

56
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,674
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

57
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,008
It's a crown.

58
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,679
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,598
is rip that thing off your head.

60
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,435
But Ragnarok has already begun.

61
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,434
You cannot stop it.

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,199
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,953
All will suffer, all will burn.

64
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,830
That's intense.

65
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,832
To be honest, seeing you grow really big...

66
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,536
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

67
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,337
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

68
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,256
where I bust out of these chains...

69
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,091
knock that tiara off your head,

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,295
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

71
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,430
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

72
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,723
Why fight it?

73
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,561
Because that's what heroes do.

74
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,564
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.

75
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,738
And, now!

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,909
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

77
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,620
I make grave mistakes all the time.

78
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,329
Everything seems to work out.

79
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,583
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

80
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,787
but I could really use a fast exit.

81
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,709
Heimdall?

82
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,549
Heimdall was an idiot.

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,718
This job should have made him rich.

84
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,095
Now, the job ain't easy...

85
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,094
but it does have its benefits.

86
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,516
The Bifrost gives me access to everything

87
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,602
the Nine Realms has to offer.

88
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,101
I mean it's all mine for the taking.

89
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,767
Behold...

90
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,107
my stuff.

91
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,072
I'm particularly fond of these.

92
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,784
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

93
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,034
I even named them. Des and Troy.

94
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,243
You see, when you put them together...

95
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,290
they destroy.

96
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,307
Heimdall, come on.

97
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,665
Stay!

98
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,292
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.

99
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,926
<i>Heimdall?</i>

100
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,549
Skurge?

101
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,308
Is that important?

102
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,105
You girls are in for a treat.

103
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,617
Girls!

104
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,877
Well, well, well. Look
who decided to pop in.

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,961
Thanks for scaring away my company

106
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,835
and drenching my workplace in brains.

107
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,006
Who are you?

108
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,841
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.

109
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,282
We fought together on Vanaheim.

110
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,671
Right. Where is Heimdall?

111
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,845
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

112
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,635
Traitor?

113
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,478
Yeah. Well, you see, Odin charged
Heimdall with negligence of duty...

114
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,387
but he disappeared before the trial.

115
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:26,732
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.

116
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,934
Sure.

117
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,562
Hold on. I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

118
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,345
What the hell is that?

119
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,023
Brother. This is it.

120
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,559
I take my leave.

121
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,437
You fool, you didn't listen!

122
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,729
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,821
Lady Sif, get help!

124
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,023
Somebody, help!

125
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,362
Sorry for all I've done.

126
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,281
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

127
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,864
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

128
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,374
They'd be lucky to have you.

129
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,376
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

130
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,388
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.

131
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,712
I'm a trickster.

132
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,715
So mischievous.

133
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,593
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

134
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,174
It was a wonderful joke.

135
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,429
'Twas indeed hilarious.

136
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,724
You are the saviour of Asgard.

137
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,934
- Tell my story.
- I will.

138
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,262
Build a statue for me.

139
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,146
We will build a big statue for you.

140
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,184
With my helmet on, with
the big bendy horns.

141
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,319
I will tell Father what you did here today.

142
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,150
I didn't do it for him.

143
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,988
I didn't do it for him.

144
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,915
No!

145
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,342
And so, Loki died of his wounds...

146
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,424
giving his life for ours.

147
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,260
He fought back those disgusting elves...

148
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,220
he brought peace to the realm.

149
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,681
Loki, my boy...

150
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,020
'twas many moons ago I found you

151
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,189
on that frostbitten battlefield.

152
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,439
On that day, I did not yet see in you...

153
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,899
Asgard's saviour. No.

154
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:40,568
You were merely a little
blue baby icicle...

155
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,579
that melted this old fool's heart.

156
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,542
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

157
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,289
Father.

158
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,375
Shit.

159
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,003
My son, Thor, has returned!

160
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,382
Greetings, my boy.

161
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,224
It's an interesting play. What's it called?

162
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,267
<i>The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.</i>

163
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,391
The people wanted to commemorate him.

164
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,897
Indeed they should.

165
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,357
I like the statue.

166
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,775
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

167
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,696
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.

168
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,822
Do you know what this is?

169
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,702
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

170
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,204
Do me a favour. Lock this away in a vault,
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

171
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,782
and destroy the whole planet.

172
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,959
Thank you, dear.

173
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,834
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

174
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,205
Nope.

175
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,338
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

176
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,299
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.

177
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,723
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.

178
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,890
Possibly.

179
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,051
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

180
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,227
And what do I find,

181
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,182
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

182
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,318
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise...

183
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,399
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms...

184
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,197
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.

185
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,526
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbours' freedom.

186
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,783
Yes, of course, the
freedom to be massacred.

187
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,745
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.

188
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,916
Watching theatre.

189
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,960
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

190
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,253
You're really gonna make me do it?

191
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,668
Do what?

192
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,260
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir

193
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,963
as it returns to my hand.

194
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,597
Not even your face.

195
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,975
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

196
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,678
Then I'll see you on the
other side, brother.

197
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,473
All right, I yield.

198
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,775
Behold!

199
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,826
Thor...

200
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,954
- Odinson.
- No.

201
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,999
You had one job. Just the one.

202
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,161
Where's Odin?

203
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,962
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

204
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,131
Everything was fine without you.

205
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,964
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

206
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,344
- Ask them.
- Where's Father?

207
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,054
- Did you kill him?
- You had what you wanted.

208
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,816
You had the independence you asked for.

209
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,643
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

210
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,898
I swear I left him right here.

211
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:30,160
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?

212
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,362
Great planning.

213
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,704
How was I supposed to know?

214
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,498
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.

215
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,497
No? Then why do you dress like one?

216
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,877
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.

217
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,379
I saw you die.

218
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,297
I mourned you, I cried for you.

219
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,670
I'm honoured.

220
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,008
Ask him.

221
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,760
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

222
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,970
Sure.

223
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,718
Start figuring out where he is.

224
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,599
My God.

225
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

226
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,638
She didn't dump me, you know.

227
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,977
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

228
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,943
What's this? What are you doing?

229
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,145
This isn't me.

230
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,859
Loki.

231
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,807
Thor Odinson.

232
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,898
God of Thunder.

233
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,492
You can put down the umbrella.

234
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,303
So, Earth has, wizards now?

235
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,477
The preferred term is.

236
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,718
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

237
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,939
All right, wizard.

238
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,437
Who are you? Why should I care?

239
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,651
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,

240
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,695
and I have some questions for you.

241
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,897
Take a seat.

242
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,028
Tea?

243
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,824
I don't drink tea.

244
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,242
What do you drink?

245
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,709
Not tea.

246
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,714
So, I keep a watch list

247
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,716
of individuals and beings
from other realms...

248
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,426
that may be a threat to this world.

249
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,222
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

250
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,884
He's a worthy inclusion.

251
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,307
Then why bring him here?

252
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,143
We're looking for my father.

253
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,651
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was...

254
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,316
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

255
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,654
Promptly.

256
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,073
Great! Then I'll help you.

257
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,485
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

258
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,536
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.

259
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,697
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.

260
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,914
And you don't have a phone.

261
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,796
No, I don't have a phone, but you
could have sent an electronic letter.

262
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,005
It's called an email.

263
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,047
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?

264
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,968
Anyway,

265
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,762
my father is no longer in exile.

266
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,471
So if you could tell me where he is,

267
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,673
I can take him home.

268
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,717
Gladly. He's in Norway.

269
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,769
I'm just seeing whether this incantation

270
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,974
requires any Asgardian modifications.

271
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,687
Nope.

272
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,727
We don't need that.

273
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,869
Will you stop doing that?

274
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,074
I need just one strand of your hair.

275
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,290
Let me explain something.

276
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,915
My hair is not to be meddled with.

277
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,923
We could have just walked.

278
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,515
He's waiting for you.

279
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,891
All right.

280
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,427
Don't forget your umbrella.

281
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,849
Yes.

282
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,645
Sorry.

283
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,903
There we go.

284
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,903
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

285
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,746
Yeah. Right.

286
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,288
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

287
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,460
You can handle him from here.

288
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,132
Yes. Of course.

289
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,675
Thank you very much for your help.

290
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,760
Good luck.

291
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,929
Handle me? Who are you?

292
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,673
Loki.

293
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,095
You think you're
some kind of sorcerer?

294
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,975
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

295
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,177
Bye-bye.

296
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,579
Father?

297
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,883
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

298
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,719
Father, it's us.

299
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,637
My sons.

300
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,931
I've been waiting for you.

301
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,871
I know. We've come to take you home.

302
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,692
Home, yes.

303
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,651
Your mother, she calls me.

304
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,191
Do you hear it?

305
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,866
Loki, lift your magic.

306
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,034
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.

307
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,703
Frigga would have been proud.

308
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,497
Come and sit with me. I
don't have much time.

309
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,880
I know that we failed you.

310
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,340
But we can make this right.

311
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,308
I failed you.

312
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,937
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

313
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,895
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

314
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,683
No.

315
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,235
It has already begun. She's coming.

316
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,488
My life was all that held her back.

317
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,690
But my time has come.

318
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,362
I cannot keep her away any longer.

319
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,326
Father, who are you talking about?

320
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,993
Goddess of Death. Hela.

321
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,582
My firstborn.

322
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,789
Your sister.

323
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,544
Your what?

324
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,848
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

325
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,060
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.

326
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,353
Locked her away.

327
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,601
She draws her strength from Asgard...

328
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:21,367
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

329
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,072
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.

330
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,274
We can face her together.

331
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,526
No, we won't.

332
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,662
I'm on a different path now.

333
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,285
This you must face alone.

334
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,418
I love you, my sons.

335
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,623
Look at that.

336
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,382
Remember this place.

337
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,256
Home.

338
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,259
Brother.

339
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,690
This was your doing.

340
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,484
So he's gone.

341
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,699
That's a shame. I would've
liked to have seen that.

342
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,613
You must be Hela.

343
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,529
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

344
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,200
Really? You don't look like him.

345
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,368
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

346
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,412
You sound like him.

347
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,498
Kneel.

348
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,007
Beg your pardon?

349
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,842
Kneel.

350
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,935
Before your queen.

351
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,597
I don't think so.

352
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,318
It's not possible.

353
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,035
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.

354
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,226
Bring us back!

355
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,428
No!

356
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,605
Loki!

357
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,457
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?

358
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,622
I'm Hela.

359
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,501
I'm just a janitor.

360
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,089
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

361
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,844
How would you like a job?

362
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,814
Are you a fighter?

363
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,975
Or are you food?

364
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,144
I'm just passing through.

365
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,149
It is food.

366
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,522
On your knees.

367
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,608
He's mine.

368
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:12,993
Wait!

369
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,044
Wait!

370
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,381
He's mine.

371
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,726
So if you want him, you go through me.

372
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,345
But we've already got him.

373
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,940
All right, then. I guess I go through you.

374
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,943
More food.

375
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,638
Thank you.

376
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,476
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

377
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,725
I've got something special.

378
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,231
Hey! Where are you taking me?

379
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,893
Answer me!

380
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,360
Hey!

381
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,189
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

382
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,450
Many apologies, your majesty.

383
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,728
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

384
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:51,325
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn...

385
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,779
the commander of the Legions of Asgard...

386
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,579
the rightful heir to the throne,

387
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,327
and the Goddess of Death.

388
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,498
My father is dead.

389
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,541
As are the princes. You're welcome.

390
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,509
We were once the seat

391
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,587
of absolute power in the cosmos.

392
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,968
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

393
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,226
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

394
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,809
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

395
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,771
And I am here to restore that power.

396
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,861
Kneel before me...

397
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,987
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

398
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,324
Whoever you are...

399
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,451
whatever you've done, surrender now!

400
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,833
Or we will show you no mercy.

401
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,417
Whoever I am?

402
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,212
Did you listen to a word I said?

403
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,373
This is your last warning!

404
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,719
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

405
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,767
Fine.

406
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,365
Charge!

407
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,546
I've missed this.

408
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,499
Still, it's a shame.

409
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,342
Good soldiers dying for nothing...

410
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,716
all because they couldn't see the future.

411
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,423
Sad.

412
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,634
Look, still alive.

413
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,901
Change of heart?

414
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,563
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.

415
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,323
You evil demoness!

416
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,283
Let's go see my palace.

417
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,480
<i>Fear not, for you are found.</i>

418
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,532
<i>You are home, and there is no going back.</i>

419
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,955
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

420
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,827
<i>But what is this place?</i>

421
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,127
<i>The answer is Sakaar.</i>

422
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,255
<i>Surrounded by cosmic gateways...</i>

423
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,175
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.</i>

424
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,010
<i>It is the collection point</i>

425
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,884
<i>for all lost and unloved things...</i>

426
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,840
<i>like you.</i>

427
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,676
<i>But here on Sakaar, you are significant.</i>

428
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,268
<i>You are valuable.</i>

429
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,978
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

430
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,104
What the hell?

431
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,354
<i>And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.</i>

432
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,485
<i>He is the original,</i>

433
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,734
<i>the first lost and the first found...</i>

434
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,030
<i>the creator of Sakaar...</i>

435
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,405
<i>and father of the Contest of Champions.</i>

436
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:05,864
<i>Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.</i>

437
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,246
<i>You are the property of the Grandmaster.</i>

438
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,960
<i>Congratulations!</i>

439
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,547
<i>You will meet the Grandmaster in 5 seconds.</i>

440
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,250
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

441
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,294
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

442
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,224
<i>You are now meeting the Grandmaster.</i>

443
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,398
He's wonderful. It is a he?

444
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,781
It is a he.

445
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,983
Yeah.

446
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,118
I love when you come to visit, 142.

447
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,821
You bring me the best stuff.

448
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,788
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,

449
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,707
about Scrapper 142...

450
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,166
what do I always say?

451
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,335
"She is the..." And it starts with a "B."

452
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,537
Trash.

453
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,298
No, not trash.

454
00:36:58,006 --> 00:36:59,591
Were you waiting just to call her that?

455
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,169
It doesn't start with a "B."

456
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,462
Booze hag.

457
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,516
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

458
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,059
'Cause I always say you're the best.

459
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,061
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

460
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,022
You say that every time she's here.

461
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,565
What have you brought today? Tell me.

462
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,767
A contender.

463
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,976
A what?

464
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,270
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

465
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,318
Can you take us closer? Thank you.

466
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,877
Pay this lady.

467
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,705
Just wait a damn minute.

468
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,249
I'm not for sale.

469
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,215
Man, he's a fighter.

470
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,675
I take 10 million.

471
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,968
Tell her she's dreaming.

472
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,019
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

473
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,611
You'll pay for this.

474
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,197
No, I got paid for this.

475
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,910
Here's what I wanna know.

476
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,243
Who are you?

477
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:12,415
I am the God of Thunder.

478
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,909
Wow.

479
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:19,126
I didn't hear any thunder, but out
of your fingers, was that sparkles?

480
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,674
We've located your cousin.

481
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,760
Good!

482
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,005
Yeah, come on. I think
you're gonna like this.

483
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,221
There he is.

484
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,514
Hey, cuz.

485
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,350
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

486
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,848
Hi.

487
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,556
So...

488
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,848
Please.

489
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,059
I'm sorry.

490
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,355
Yeah.

491
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,687
Carlo...

492
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,071
I pardon you.

493
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,489
Thank you.

494
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,691
Thank you.

495
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,862
You're officially pardoned. From life.

496
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,910
Help me.

497
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,205
My God!

498
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,590
I'm stepping in it. I'm
stepping in it. Look!

499
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,546
Wow.

500
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,506
The smell.

501
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,137
What does it smell like?

502
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,594
Burnt toast.

503
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,391
What happened to my manners?

504
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,239
I haven't properly introduced myself.

505
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,267
Come on. Follow me.

506
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,689
My name is Grandmaster.

507
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,566
I preside over a little harlequinade

508
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,189
called the Contest of Champions.

509
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,108
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.

510
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,073
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.

511
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,199
What do you say to that?

512
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,403
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

513
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,863
I'm going back to Asgard.

514
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,331
Ass-gard.

515
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,118
One, two, three, four.

516
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,879
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

517
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,209
At that moment, I let go.

518
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,459
Loki?

519
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,512
Loki! Loki!

520
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,008
Over here. Over here.

521
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,475
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!

522
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,519
- What?
- You're alive?

523
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,393
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

524
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,564
What do you mean, what am I doing?

525
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,648
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

526
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,146
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

527
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,693
- Get me out of this one.
- I can't.

528
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,111
- Get me out. What?
- I can't.

529
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,195
I've made friends with this man.

530
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,280
He's called the Grandmaster.

531
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,608
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favour.

532
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,450
The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.

533
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,652
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

534
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,861
I just got here.

535
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,312
What are you whispering about?

536
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,123
Time works real different
around these parts.

537
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,248
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

538
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,038
But here on Sakaar...

539
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,011
In any case, you know this...

540
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,429
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

541
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,008
God of Thunder. Tell him.

542
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,888
I've never met this man in my life.

543
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,560
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

544
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,882
Is he any kind of a fighter?

545
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,397
You take this thing
out of my neck and I'll show you.

546
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,232
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.

547
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,310
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

548
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,696
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

549
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,905
Asgard.

550
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,950
Any contender who defeats my champion...

551
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,869
their freedom they shall win.

552
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,578
Fine. Then point me in the direction

553
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,247
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

554
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,997
That's what I call, contender.

555
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,540
Direction would be this way, Lord.

556
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,213
Loki!

557
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,088
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, man.

558
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,847
Over here.

559
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,568
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

560
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,153
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

561
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:21,979
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

562
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,563
I'm kind of like the leader in here.

563
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,399
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

564
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,068
But don't let that intimidate you.

565
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,150
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.

566
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,607
Just a little rock-paper-scissor
joke for you.

567
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,527
This is my very good
friend over here, Miek.

568
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,446
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

569
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,494
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

570
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,334
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

571
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,503
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

572
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,963
So hardly anyone turned up,

573
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,758
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

574
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,259
As punishment, I was forced

575
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,838
to be in here and become a gladiator.

576
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,471
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

577
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,215
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

578
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,560
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.

579
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,434
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

580
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,724
How did you...

581
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,568
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

582
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,901
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

583
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,281
This doesn't make any sense.

584
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,824
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

585
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,284
The only thing that does make sense

586
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,862
is that nothing makes sense.

587
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,414
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

588
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,664
Doug has.

589
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,866
Doug!

590
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,000
Our luck, Doug's dead.

591
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,168
That's right.

592
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,628
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

593
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,627
What about you? You're made of rocks.

594
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,422
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

595
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,429
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

596
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,353
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

597
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,929
Yes, I am.

598
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,391
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.

599
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,889
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

600
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,941
See you later, new Doug.

601
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,486
Does no one remember me?

602
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,532
Has no one been taught our history?

603
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,671
Look at these lies.

604
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,840
Goblets and garden parties?

605
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,756
Peace treaties?

606
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,797
Odin...

607
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,548
proud to have it...

608
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,092
ashamed of how he got it.

609
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,537
We were unstoppable.

610
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:48,209
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.

611
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,378
One by one, the realms became ours.

612
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:58,719
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

613
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,554
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

614
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,598
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honoured...

615
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:10,390
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

616
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,323
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.

617
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,037
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

618
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,833
Or weak.

619
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,913
Smaller than I thought it would be.

620
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,464
That's not bad.

621
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,338
But this...

622
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,046
The Eternal Flame.

623
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,663
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

624
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,115
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

625
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,656
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

626
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,135
I've missed you.

627
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,888
I've missed you all.

628
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,721
Odin...

629
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:17,188
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

630
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,728
where the brave shall live forever.

631
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,523
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice...

632
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,031
for those that have died...

633
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,712
The glorious death.

634
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,914
Hurts, doesn't it?

635
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,203
Being lied to.

636
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,540
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.

637
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,471
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

638
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,299
This place is disgusting.

639
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,020
Does this mean you don't want my help?

640
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,188
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

641
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,648
It took me time to win his trust.

642
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,410
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

643
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,735
What I'm telling you is,

644
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,734
you could join me at the
Grandmaster's side.

645
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:08,534
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

646
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,951
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

647
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,005
Our sister destroyed your hammer

648
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,583
like a piece of glass.

649
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:26,343
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

650
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,802
You don't stand a chance.

651
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,176
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

652
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,719
Fine.

653
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,899
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

654
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,810
Like I've always done.

655
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,110
Would you say something?

656
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,322
Say something!

657
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,664
What would you like me to say?

658
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,249
You faked your own death...

659
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,036
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

660
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,456
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.

661
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,322
Have I said enough or would you like me to
go back further than the past two days?

662
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,220
You know, I haven't seen this

663
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,469
beloved champion he talks of...

664
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,633
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

665
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,020
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

666
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,389
Don't let me down.

667
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,857
Piss off, ghost!

668
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,907
He's freaking gone.

669
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,249
Yuck!

670
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,544
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

671
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,002
Guys, can you clean up the weapons

672
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,379
once you finish your fight?

673
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,581
Disgusting slobs.

674
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,254
Thor...

675
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,549
wanna use a big wooden fork?

676
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,845
No.

677
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,218
Yeah, not really useful.

678
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,014
Unless you're fighting off three vampires

679
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,808
that were huddled together.

680
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,269
I really wish I had my hammer.

681
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,679
Hammer?

682
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,272
Quite unique. It was made from this

683
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,441
special metal from the
heart of a dying star.

684
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:06,359
And when I spun it really, really fast,

685
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,986
it gave me the ability to fly.

686
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,188
You rode a hammer?

687
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,860
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

688
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,490
The hammer rode you on your back?

689
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,159
No. I used to spin it really fast,

690
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,827
and it would pull me off the...

691
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,996
My God. A hammer pulled you off?

692
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,831
The ground. It would
pull me off the ground,

693
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,830
up into the air, and I would fly.

694
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,001
Every time I threw it,

695
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,000
it would always come back to me.

696
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,839
Sounds like you had a pretty special and
intimate relationship with this hammer...

697
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,047
and that losing it was almost
comparable to losing a loved one.

698
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,263
That's a nice way of putting it.

699
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,175
I said they're mine.

700
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,594
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

701
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,021
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

702
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,231
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.

703
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,025
They are hard to perish.

704
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,603
Asgardian?

705
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,314
Hey. Hey.

706
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,066
Hey.

707
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,069
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

708
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,156
Asgard is in danger.

709
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,128
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

710
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,423
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

711
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,008
until I found out that you were all women.

712
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,092
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

713
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,294
I love women.

714
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,925
Sometimes a little too much.

715
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,055
Not in a creepy way,

716
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,974
just more of a respectful appreciation.

717
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,391
I think it's great that there is

718
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,641
an elite force of women warriors.

719
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,309
It's about time.

720
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,815
Are you done?

721
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,900
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

722
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,068
Please, help me. I need your help.

723
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,152
Bye.

724
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,526
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

725
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,067
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

726
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,867
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

727
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,080
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

728
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,286
Bring him in for processing.

729
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,382
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

730
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,770
Now, don't you move.

731
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,640
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

732
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,689
By Odin's beard, you
shall not cut my hair...

733
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,487
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

734
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,236
Please. Please, kind
sir, do not cut my hair.

735
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,912
Please! No!

736
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,160
No!

737
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,095
<i>Wow! Look at all of you</i>.

738
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,969
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

739
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,216
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

740
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,010
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

741
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,311
<i>Big round of applause</i>

742
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,389
<i>for all of our undercard competitors...</i>

743
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,358
<i>who today died so gruesomely.</i>

744
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,727
<i>Good sports.</i>

745
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,569
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

746
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,900
<i>This is what you've come
for, and so have I.</i>

747
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,665
<i>And now, without further ado...</i>

748
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,369
<i>it's main event time.</i>

749
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,630
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

750
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,378
<i>though he looks quite promising...</i>

751
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,506
<i>got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.</i>

752
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,550
<i>I'll say no more, see what you think.</i>

753
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,446
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...</i>

754
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,513
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

755
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,875
<i>Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.</i>

756
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,419
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

757
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,835
<i>Let's get ready to welcome
this guy. Here he comes.</i>

758
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,262
<i>He is a creature.</i>

759
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,642
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

760
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,312
<i>Well, he's unique. There's none like him.</i>

761
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,978
<i>I feel a special connection with him.</i>

762
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,980
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

763
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,858
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

764
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,321
<i>He's the defending.</i>

765
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,818
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

766
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,236
<i>I give you...</i>

767
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,791
<i>Your Incredible...</i>

768
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,467
Hulk!

769
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,427
Yes!

770
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,224
I have to get off this planet.

771
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,719
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

772
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,229
Hey!

773
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,156
We know each other.

774
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,483
He's a friend from work.

775
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,414
Where have you been?

776
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,622
Everybody thought you were dead.

777
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,714
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

778
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,841
I lost my hammer.

779
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,012
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

780
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,718
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

781
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,053
He's up there.

782
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,180
Loki! Look who it is!

783
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,313
Banner, I never thought I would say this...

784
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,767
but I'm happy to see you.

785
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,444
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

786
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,234
Banner.

787
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,612
Hey, Banner!

788
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,198
No Banner. Only Hulk.

789
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,623
What are you doing?

790
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,701
It's me. It's Thor!

791
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,271
Banner, we're friends.

792
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,440
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

793
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,408
Here we go.

794
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,344
What?

795
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,266
Hey, big guy.

796
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,102
The sun's getting real low.

797
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,749
That's it. The sun's going down.

798
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,462
I won't hurt you any more.

799
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,123
No one will.

800
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,304
Yes! That's how it feels!

801
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,435
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

802
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,575
All right. Screw it.

803
00:57:03,031 --> 00:57:04,295
I know you're in there, Banner.

804
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,497
I'll get you out!

805
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,766
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

806
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,094
I told them we were friends!

807
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:52,446
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

808
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:59,033
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

809
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,312
Another day, another Doug.

810
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,493
What is that noise?

811
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,413
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.

812
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,504
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

813
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,795
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

814
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,515
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

815
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,557
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.

816
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,510
What I meant was...

817
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,308
what's your ambition?

818
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,850
I just want a chance to prove myself.

819
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,601
Recognition.

820
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,229
When I was young...

821
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:19,149
every great king had an executioner.

822
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,364
Not just to execute people...

823
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,120
but also to execute their vision.

824
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,912
But mainly to execute people.

825
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,122
Still, it was a great honour.

826
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,672
I was Odin's executioner.

827
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:40,053
And you shall be my executioner.

828
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,552
Let's begin our conquest.

829
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,486
Skurge, where's the sword?

830
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:09,625
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

831
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,458
Those people you mentioned,

832
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,662
the ones who aren't falling into line...

833
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,421
round them up.

834
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,776
Excuse me.

835
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,168
Sorry about that.

836
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,769
These bloody things are everywhere.

837
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,123
Come on.

838
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,667
You'll be safe here.

839
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,146
Are we cool?

840
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,447
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

841
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,385
So how long have you been like that?

842
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,035
Like what?

843
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,957
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

844
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,251
Hulk always Hulk.

845
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,424
How'd you get here?

846
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,220
Winning.

847
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,889
You mean cheating?

848
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,434
Were they wearing one
of these when you won?

849
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,848
How'd you arrive here?

850
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,847
Quinjet.

851
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,567
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

852
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:29,399
That's naked.

853
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,277
He's very naked.

854
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,077
It's in my brain now.

855
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,908
Quinjet.

856
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,928
Yes!

857
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,548
I'm getting us out of here.

858
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,175
This is a terrible, awful place.

859
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:59,055
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

860
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,597
Hulk stay.

861
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,150
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

862
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,691
We must prevent Ragnarok.

863
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,112
Ragnarok?

864
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,863
The prophesied death of my home world.

865
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,464
The end of days, it's the end of...

866
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,786
If you help me get back to Asgard...

867
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,038
I can help you get back to Earth.

868
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,324
Earth hate Hulk.

869
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,959
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.

870
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,418
You're one of the Avengers.

871
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,059
One of the team, one of our friends.

872
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,374
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

873
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,673
You're Banner's friend.

874
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,005
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

875
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,218
Banner's friend.

876
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:32,344
I don't even like Banner.

877
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,344
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

878
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,304
Thor go. Hulk stay.

879
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,718
Fine.

880
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,303
Stay here.

881
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,523
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

882
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:47,151
The red, the white.
Just pick a colour. Ridiculous.

883
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,194
Smash you.

884
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,652
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

885
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,942
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

886
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,860
- Baby arms.
- What?

887
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,202
Baby.

888
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,825
Moron! You big child.

889
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,080
Thor go!

890
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,033
I am going.

891
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,414
Thor go again.

892
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,465
Thor home.

893
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,064
Hulk trains.

894
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,316
That's great. Have fun.

895
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,151
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.

896
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,524
What have you been up to?

897
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,854
Winning.

898
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,460
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

899
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,587
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

900
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,041
Help me see.

901
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,896
I see you, but you're far away.

902
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,019
What's going on here?

903
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,645
Come see for yourself.

904
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,736
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold

905
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,938
built by our ancestors.

906
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,693
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

907
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,906
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

908
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,995
We won't last long if we stay.

909
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,875
She draws her power from Asgard

910
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,236
and grows stronger every day.

911
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,495
Come on.

912
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,960
Hela is ravenous.

913
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,134
If I let her leave,

914
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,136
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

915
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,346
We need you.

916
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:41,947
I'm working on it. But I don't
even know where the hell I am.

917
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,393
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

918
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,392
- Which one?
- The big one.

919
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,630
Thor sad.

920
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,176
Shut up.

921
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,014
Thor sad.

922
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,884
I'm not sad, you idiot.

923
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,011
I'm pissed off!

924
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,648
Angry. I lost my father.

925
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:34,276
I lost my hammer.

926
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,944
- You're not even listening.
- Whining and crying.

927
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,317
Cry like baby.

928
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,198
Don't kick stuff.

929
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,656
You're being a really bad friend.

930
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:43,945
You bad friend!

931
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,454
- You know what we call you?
- No.

932
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,282
We call you the stupid Avenger.

933
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,500
You're tiny Avenger!

934
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,287
What, are you crazy?

935
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,463
Yes.

936
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:57,042
You know what? Earth does hate you.

937
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,822
No. -

938
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,865
I'm sorry I said those things.

939
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,870
You're not the stupid Avenger.

940
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,119
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

941
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,246
It's okay.

942
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,710
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.

943
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,003
I know. I'm sorry.

944
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,755
I just get so angry all the time.

945
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,004
Hulk always, always angry.

946
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,552
I know. We're the same, you and I.

947
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,762
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

948
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:47,684
Yeah, same. Hulk like
fire, Thor like water.

949
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,394
We're kind of both like fire.

950
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,555
But Hulk like real fire.

951
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:55,976
Hulk like raging fire.

952
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,353
Thor like smouldering fire.

953
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,732
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

954
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,782
Angry girl.

955
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,375
What's going on? What are you...

956
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,351
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

957
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,267
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone.

958
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:37,058
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.

959
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,942
I need her to stay.

960
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,144
Stay?

961
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,771
Block.

962
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,073
Stay.

963
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,867
- Please.
- Please.

964
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,655
All right.

965
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,708
Here's the deal.

966
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,002
I'll listen to you...

967
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,046
till this is empty.

968
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:02,793
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

969
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,801
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

970
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,003
Wow.

971
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,510
Finished. Bye.

972
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,509
Odin is dead.

973
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,106
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

974
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,526
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.

975
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,069
I'm going to stop her.

976
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,063
- Alone?
- Nope.

977
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,531
I'm putting together a team.

978
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,484
It's me, you, and the big guy.

979
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,079
No. No team. Only Hulk.

980
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,830
It's me and you.

981
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,080
I think it's only you.

982
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,541
Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie are legend.

983
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,086
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

984
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,714
I'm not getting dragged into another
one of Odin's family squabbles.

985
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,633
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

986
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,632
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.

987
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,301
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace...

988
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,931
and tried to seize the throne.

989
01:11:51,104 --> 01:11:52,808
When she tried to escape her banishment...

990
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,307
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

991
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,932
I only survived because...

992
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,942
Look, I already faced her once

993
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,895
back when I believed in the throne...

994
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,233
and it cost me everything.

995
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,947
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

996
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,526
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

997
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,069
I agree.

998
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,363
Don't get familiar.

999
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,240
I agree.

1000
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,971
That's why I turned down the throne.

1001
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,959
But this isn't about the crown.

1002
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,207
This is about the people.

1003
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,337
They're dying and they're your people, too.

1004
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:23,957
Forget it.

1005
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,334
I have.

1006
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,676
- Okay.
- Okay.

1007
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,010
- Good. Great.
- Great.

1008
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,136
Thank you.

1009
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,884
- For what?
- For this.

1010
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,434
Didn't see that, did you?

1011
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,017
There... That's better.

1012
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,600
You know, go ahead.

1013
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:47,273
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

1014
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,815
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1015
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,198
But me...

1016
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,994
I choose to run toward my problems

1017
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,322
and not away from them.

1018
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:57,706
Because that's what...

1019
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,835
Because that's what heroes do.

1020
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,806

1021
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:30,986
Yes!

1022
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,580

01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,133

Banner.

1053

Hey, hey, hey.

You all right, Banner?

1055

Sun's going down.

1059
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,027
- Thor.
- Yeah.

1060
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,276
What happened to your hair?

1061
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,765
Some creepy old man cut it off.

1062
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,324
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

1063
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,740
Where are we? How's Nat?

1064
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:46,951
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?

1065
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,957
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

1066
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,606
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?

1067
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:51,960
- Banner, listen.
- What?

1068
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:54,083
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.

1069
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,793
- What are you saying?
- Well...

1070
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,044
What?

1071
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,214

1072
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:00,965
I'm afraid so.

1073
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,180

1074
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,572

He kind of runs the place.

1088
01:16:48,152 --> 01:16:49,896
You actually lived at his house for awhile.

1089
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,098
- I did?
- Yeah.

1090
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,634
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.

1091
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:55,736
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.

1092
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,070
Doesn't sound right.

1093
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,154

1097
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,448
No.

1098
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,416
This is bad.

1099
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,460
This is really, really bad.

1100
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,884
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

1101
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,426
No, no, no.

1102
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,470
Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on.

1103
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:23,721

1104
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,160
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?

1105
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,225
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

1106
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:29,394
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

1107
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:30,596
Sun's going down.

1108
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,193
I'm upset!

1109
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,073
I'm very upset.

1110
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,321
You know what I like about
being upset? The blame.

1111
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,539
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.

1112
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,900
And you know who I'm blaming?

1113
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,458
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!

1114
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:53,660
Don't interrupt me!

1115
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,870
Here you go.

1116
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,130
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1117
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:58,958
He was interrupting.

1118
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:01,006
That's not a capital violation.

1119
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,465
Where was I?

1120
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,347
My precious champion has come up missing...

1121
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,473
and it's all because of
that Lord of Thunder.

1122
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,847
It's all because of him. Your brother.

1123
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,937
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1124
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,189
I'm sure there's a big history.

1125
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,391
And your contender...

1126
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,142
My dear friend...

1127
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,730
if you were to give me 12 hours,
I could bring them both back to you. Alive.

1128
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,401
I could do it in two.

1129
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,400
I could do it in one.

1130
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,651
Let's stop there.

1131
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,452
You know what? I woke up this morning

1132
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,371
thinking about a public execution.

1133
01:18:29,595 --> 01:18:31,539
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1134
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,459
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1135
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:38,039
So, you're on the clock.

1136
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,007
What have you done?

1137
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:42,383
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1138
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,585
It's Loki.

1139
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:45,355
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1140
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,268
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1141
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,804
I don't help anyone.

1142
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,477
You're a Valkyrie.

1143
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,606
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1144
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,488
Choose your next words wisely.

1145
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,916
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1146
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:09,221
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1147
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,639
The sun's going down.

1148
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,280
- It's getting real low.
- Shoot.

1149
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,727
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1150
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,020
I just need you to stay calm.

1151
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,064
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1152
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,857
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1153
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,105
Yeah. One.

1154
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,068
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1155
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,396
It's a new experience.

1156
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:29,609
My neurons, they're firing faster than
my brain can handle the information.

1157
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,031
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1158
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,911
In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I

1159
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,409
each had a hand on the wheel.

1160
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,332
But this time, it's like he had the keys

1161
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,125
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

1162
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,124
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1163
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:42,375
No, it's not what matters.

1164
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,298
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again...

1165
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,876
Banner may never come back.

1166
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,259
And we're stranded on a planet

1167
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,094
that is designed to stress me out.

1168
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,304
We're not stranded.

1169
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:53,181
I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.

1170
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,383
Thank you.

1171
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,719
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.

1172
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,099
What?

1173
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,938
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1174
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,732
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1175
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,685
who also happens to be my sister.

1176
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,474
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1177
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:07,779
I don't wanna fight your sister.

1178
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,155
That's a family issue.

1179
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,490
No, she's an evil being.

1180
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,367
I don't care what she is.

1181
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,741
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1182
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,988
- What?
- I just told you.

1183
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,705
If I turn into the Hulk,

1184
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,082
I am never gonna come back again.

1185
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,291
And you don't care.

1186
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,210
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1187
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,712
The Hulk is the fire.

1188
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,713
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1189
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,336
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1190
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,384
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1191
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,135
No! I don't even like the Hulk.

1192
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,553
He's all like...

1193
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,176
"Smash, smash, smash."

1194
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,424
I prefer you.

1195
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,342
Thanks.

1196
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:41,180
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings...

1197
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,727
he is very powerful and useful.

1198
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,854
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1199
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,234
Is he though?

1200
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,521
How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.

1201
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,481
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

1202
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,317
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1203
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,368
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1204
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,498
What are you doing with that?

1205
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,582
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1206
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,503
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1207
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,796
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1208
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,756
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1209
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,459
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1210
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,927
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

1211
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:13,136
Because you were naked.

1212
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,464
Okay, I'll give you that.

1213
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:16,472
What are you doing? Stop doing that!

1214
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:17,932
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1215
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,134
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1216
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,471
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1217
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:24,015
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1218
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,646
inside of a monster made me a little weird.

1219
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,564
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

1220
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,108
You're good. Calm down. Come on.

1221
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:32,697
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard...

1222
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,983
and you're not gonna have
to think about the Hulk ever again.

1223
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:36,322
- All right?
- All right.

1224
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,078
Hulk!

1225
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,627
This is bad.

1226
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,133
Banner! Banner!

1227
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,217
Banner!

1228
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,940
Banner!

1229
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:12,605
Thor!

1230
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:24,908
Hi.

1231
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,201
Hi.

1232
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,585
I was gonna do that.

1233
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,913
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1234
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,085
That's good. What are you doing here?

1235
01:23:31,652 --> 01:23:33,716
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1236
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,918
I got sidetracked.

1237
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:36,378
What's with the...

1238
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:37,929
It's my disguise.

1239
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,131
But I can see your face.

1240
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,224
Not when I do this, you can't.

1241
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:43,643
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

1242
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:45,266
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1243
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,610
What are those things on her eyes?

1244
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,195
Are those the people that she's killed?

1245
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:55,864
She's so beautiful and
strong and courageous.

1246
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,031
Who is this guy?

1247
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,115
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?

1248
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,700
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

1249
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,824
I feel like I know you, too.

1250
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,251
Look, I've spent years in a haze,

1251
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,013
trying to forget my past.

1252
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,000
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.

1253
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,426
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1254
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:18,678
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1255
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:21,098
But I don't wanna forget.

1256
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,886
I can't turn away any more...

1257
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:25,306
so if I'm gonna die...

1258
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:28,729
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1259
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,398
- Good.
- Yeah.

1260
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,561
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.

1261
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,486
Has it got a name?

1262
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,361
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1263
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:39,615
Revengers?

1264
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:42,194
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1265
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,329
Do you want revenge?

1266
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,658
I'm undecided.

1267
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,950
Okay.

1268
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,336
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1269
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,466
Surprise.

1270
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,933
Just had to be sure.

1271
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,721
Hello, Bruce.

1272
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:14,101
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.

1273
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,513
Where are you at these days?

1274
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,779
It varies from moment to moment.

1275
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,073
Is that a Dragonfang?

1276
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:21,699
It is.

1277
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,947
My God.

1278
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,870
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1279
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,788
Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart

1280
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,161
as any two known systems.

1281
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:32,161
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1282
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,337
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard

1283
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:36,006
in 18 months.

1284
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:39,418
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1285
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,669
The Devil's Anus?

1286
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,011
Anus?

1287
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,220
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1288
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,389
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.

1289
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,058
That looks like a
collapsing neutron star...

1290
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,683
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1291
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,145
We need another ship.

1292
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,768
That would tear mine to pieces.

1293
01:25:52,778 --> 01:25:54,482
She's right. We need one
that can withstand

1294
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,775
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

1295
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,777
And has an offline power steering system...

1296
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,606
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

1297
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,073
And we need one with cup holders,

1298
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,821
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1299
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,990
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1300
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:07,988
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1301
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:09,239
What do you say?

1302
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:11,999
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1303
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,292
Talk about an adventure.

1304
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,582
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1305
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,712
There are one or two ships.

1306
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:17,880
Absolute top of the line models...

1307
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,378
I don't mean to impose...

1308
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,556
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.

1309
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:28,516
I may even have stolen the access
codes to his security system.

1310
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,977
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.

1311
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,144
Heavens, no.

1312
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,854
I've run out of favour
with the Grandmaster...

1313
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,975
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1314
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:39,231
I'm asking for safe
passage through the Anus.

1315
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:42,029
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage...

1316
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,857
without setting off any alarms?

1317
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,863
Yes, brother. I can.

1318
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:48,783
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1319
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,663
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1320
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,284
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.

1321
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,625
He did try to kill me.

1322
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,628
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1323
01:26:56,677 --> 01:26:58,421
There was one time when we were children...

1324
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:01,340
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.

1325
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,342
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1326
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:06,220
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1327
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,300
And he stabbed me. We
were eight at the time.

1328
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:10,975
If we're boosting a ship...

1329
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,678
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1330
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,225
Why not set the beast loose?

1331
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,430
Shut up.

1332
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,681
You guys have a beast?

1333
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,188
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1334
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,776
We're going to start a revolution.

1335
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,445
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

1336
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:25,194
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

1337
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,702
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you...

1338
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:31,075
or are they eggs?

1339
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:33,699
Looks like eggs.

1340
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,467
I'm looking for Korg.

1341
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,006
Who's asking?

1342
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:47,344
I know you're asking.

1343
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,506
Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?

1344
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,807
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1345
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,473
The revolution has begun.

1346
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,729
Revolution? How did this happen?

1347
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,438
Don't know.

1348
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:04,779
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated...

1349
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,906
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1350
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,075
I don't like that word.

1351
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,535
Which? Mainframe?

1352
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:12,780
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1353
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,997
No, the "S" word.

1354
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,789
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1355
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,545
Okay, that's better.

1356
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,553
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.

1357
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,052
I disagree.

1358
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:34,347
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

1359
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,684
You have no idea.

1360
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:38,354
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1361
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:39,556
Hello.

1362
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,641
Hi.

1363
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,279
Odin brought us together.

1364
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,158
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1365
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,288
We might as well be strangers now.

1366
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,507
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1367
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,313
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1368
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,672
Here's the thing.

1369
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,723
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1370
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,551
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1371
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,892
Did you just agree with me?

1372
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,730
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1373
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,524
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1374
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,318
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1375
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,153
Do you truly think so little of me?

1376
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,024
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1377
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,702
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

1378
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,705
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1379
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,868
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

1380
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,541
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.

1381
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,335
Yeah.

1382
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,888
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.

1383
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:55,289
That's what you always wanted.

1384
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,187
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1385
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,313
- What?
- "Get Help."

1386
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,397
No.

1387
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,481
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.

1388
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:05,566
It's great. It works every time.

1389
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,276
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?

1390
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:08,986
- No.
- We're doing it.

1391
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,860
We are not doing "Get Help."

1392
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:13,161
Get help! Please!

1393
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,400
My brother, he's dying.

1394
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,532
Get help! Help him!

1395
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,788
Classic.

1396
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,332
Still hate it.

1397
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,786
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

1398
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,961
Now, which one's the
ship she told us to get?

1399
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:27,163
<i>The Commodore.</i>

1400
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,082
Right.

1401
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,338
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1402
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,262
Loki.

1403
01:30:39,262 --> 01:30:42,686
I know I've betrayed you many times before,
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1404
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,563
The reward for your capture

1405
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:45,856
will set me up nicely.

1406
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:47,563
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1407
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,186
Easier to let it burn.

1408
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:50,520
I agree.

1409
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:00,697
That looks painful.

1410
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,163
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1411
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,332
I trust you, you betray me.

1412
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,584
Round and round in circles we go.

1413
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,749
See, Loki, life is about,
it's about growth.

1414
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,167
It's about change.

1415
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,387
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1416
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,718
I guess what I'm trying to say...

1417
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,809
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief...

1418
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:22,435
but you could be more.

1419
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,977
I'll just put this over here for you.

1420
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:30,944
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck.

1421
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,720
All right, I can figure this out.

1422
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,861
It's just another spaceship.

1423
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:54,633
<i>Loyal Sakaarians...</i>

1424
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,593
<i>Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship</i>

1425
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:58,171
<i>and my favourite champion.</i>

1426
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:02,891
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.</i>

1427
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,719
<i>Do not let him leave this planet.</i>

1428
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:19,193
- Good shot!
- Thanks.

1429
01:32:21,698 --> 01:32:23,162
<i>Open the doors.</i>

1430
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:24,660
Okay.

1431
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,754
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

1432
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,002
Why?

1433
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:47,144
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?

1434
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,346
Yes, we should.

1435
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,432
Where are the guns on this ship?

1436
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,020
<i>There aren't any.</i>

1437
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:53,817
- It's a leisure vessel.
<i>- What?</i>

1438
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:55,444
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,

1439
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:56,646
orgies and stuff.

1440
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,197
Did she just say the Grandmaster

1441
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,525
uses it for orgies?

1442
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:00,901
Yeah.

1443
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,447
Don't touch anything.

1444
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,177
No!

1445
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:28,177
- No!
- No!

1446
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:36,231
Get inside!

1447
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,941
In a minute.

1448
01:33:49,019 --> 01:33:51,083
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1449
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:52,751
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

1450
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:54,586
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

1451
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:58,007
None of them are for
flying alien spaceships!

1452
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:33,667
Okay, come on.

1453
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,836
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1454
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,038
That looks like a gun.

1455
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:39,548
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

1456
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:40,796
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

1457
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,752
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

1458
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:51,894
Yeah!

1459
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,539
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!

1460
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:19,330
There she is.

1461
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,465
Our ticket out of here.

1462
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:23,297
Hey, what's this?

1463
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,306
Thank you.

1464
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:31,892
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1465
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:33,094
You wanna come?

1466
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:35,979
You do seem like

1467
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:37,741
you're in desperate need of leadership.

1468
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,521
Why, thank you.

1469
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:44,397
Here we go.

1470
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,946
Shit.

1471
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,223
Asgardians...

1472
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:13,890
some misguided soul...

1473
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:16,721
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1474
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,273
Tell us where it is...

1475
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:22,060
or there will be consequences.

1476
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:27,024
Bad ones.

1477
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,360
Well?

1478
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:39,494
You.

1479
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:19,709
Well? Executioner?

1480
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:25,839
Wait!

1481
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,041
Wait!

1482
01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:30,590
I know where the sword is.

1483
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:16,011
I never thought I'd be back here.

1484
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:21,197
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1485
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,021
I mean, not that it's not nice.

1486
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:24,599
It's just, it's on fire.

1487
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,089
Here, up here in the mountains.

1488
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:28,360
Heat signatures. People clustered together.

1489
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,472
She's coming for them.

1490
01:38:29,473 --> 01:38:30,737
Okay, drop me off at the palace

1491
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:33,066
- and I'll draw her away.
- And get yourself killed?

1492
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:34,825
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1493
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:37,536
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you two
to help get everyone off Asgard.

1494
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,614
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1495
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,828
I have a man on the ground.

1496
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,706
Asgard.

1497
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:53,507
She's here.

1498
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,815
Now the ship has a gun.

1499
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,150
I'll take it from here.

1500
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,980
I found this in the armoury.

1501
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:16,359
Good luck.

1502
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:19,241
Your Majesty...

1503
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,369
don't die.

1504
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:26,995
You know what I mean.

1505
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,805
We must keep moving!

1506
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:30,190
Go to the Bifrost!

1507
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:14,067
Sister.

1508
01:41:16,153 --> 01:41:17,980
You're still alive.

1509
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:20,031
I love what you've done with the place.

1510
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:21,575
Redecorating, I see.

1511
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,868
It seems our father's solution

1512
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:26,538
to every problem was to cover it up.

1513
01:41:27,957 --> 01:41:29,659
Or to cast it out.

1514
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:35,419
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1515
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:37,375
You see?

1516
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,173
You never knew him.

1517
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:42,338
Not at his best.

1518
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:45,390
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations

1519
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:47,093
in blood and tears.

1520
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:50,183
Where do you think all this gold came from?

1521
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,064
And then, one day...

1522
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:55,227
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1523
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,062
To foster peace, to protect life...

1524
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,781
to have you.

1525
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,613
I understand why you're angry.

1526
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:07,603
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.

1527
01:42:07,604 --> 01:42:09,748
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1528
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:11,076
But it can't be you.

1529
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:14,829
You're just... The worst.

1530
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:18,044
Okay, get up.

1531
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:20,292
You're in my seat.

1532
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,337
You know, Father once told me...

1533
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,056
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1534
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,722
But must always be ready for it.

1535
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:02,377
Go back!

1536
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:08,800
Go!

1537
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:46,337
To be honest, I expected more.

1538
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:50,591
Heimdall!

1539
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:54,554
The sword!

1540
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,609
Here's the difference between us.

1541
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:02,403
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1542
01:44:02,445 --> 01:44:04,943
the rightful heir, the saviour of Asgard.

1543
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,948
And you're nothing.

1544
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:20,000
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

1545
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:25,960
Now you remind me of Dad.

1546
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:38,018
The stupid dog won't die!

1547
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,838
Everything's gonna be
all right now. I got this.

1548
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,298
You wanted to know who I am?

1549
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:07,877
What the hell are you talking about?

1550
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,465
You'll see!

1551
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,346
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1552
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,896
I'll get that sword...

1553
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:04,725
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1554
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:32,795
Hey, man.

1555
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:35,340
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1556
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:38,230
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?

1557
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:51,273
Your saviour is here.

1558
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:00,622
Did you miss me?

1559
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:02,166
Everyone, on that ship now.

1560
01:47:06,503 --> 01:47:08,751
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1561
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,040
Of course you did.

1562
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:28,984
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1563
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,191
You see...

1564
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,736
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1565
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:38,406
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1566
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:41,747
What were you the god of, again?

1567
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:55,093
Even when you had two eyes...

1568
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:57,679
you'd see only half the picture.

1569
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:02,059
She's too strong. Without
my hammer, I can't.

1570
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:06,806
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

1571
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:12,235
That hammer was to help you
control your power,

1572
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:13,688
to focus it.

1573
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:16,198
It was never your source of strength.

1574
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:19,235
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.

1575
01:48:20,285 --> 01:48:23,034
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1576
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:25,498
This could be Asgard.

1577
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:28,870
Asgard is where our people stand.

1578
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:34,501
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1579
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:44,344
I'm not as strong as you.

1580
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:48,222
No...

1581
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,892
you're stronger.

1582
01:48:59,825 --> 01:49:01,159
Tell me, brother.

1583
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,704
What were you the god of again?

1584
01:51:19,173 --> 01:51:21,421
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.

1585
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:23,093
This isn't over.

1586
01:51:30,142 --> 01:51:31,969
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1587
01:51:33,437 --> 01:51:34,770
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1588
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:37,190
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.

1589
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:38,392
It did nothing.

1590
01:51:41,987 --> 01:51:44,690
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1591
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:46,859
It won't end there.

1592
01:51:47,117 --> 01:51:50,571
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1593
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:52,496
She'll hunt us down.

1594
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:54,119
We need to stop her here and now.

1595
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,455
So what do we do?

1596
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:57,794
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1597
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:13,302
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1598
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:16,346
Loki...

1599
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,523
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1600
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:20,726
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1601
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,436
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1602
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:25,530
It's the only way.

1603
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:27,574
Bold move, brother.

1604
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:30,327
Even for me.

1605
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:34,614
Shall we?

1606
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,783
After you.

1607
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:03,819
This is madness.

1608
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:18,867
Go! Go, now!

1609
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:21,433
For Asgard.

1610
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:37,078
Hela!

1611
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:05,808
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1612
01:55:16,868 --> 01:55:18,570
Hela, enough!

1613
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:25,035
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1614
01:55:25,335 --> 01:55:28,755
Whatever game you're
playing, it won't work.

1615
01:55:28,797 --> 01:55:30,419
You can't defeat me.

1616
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:32,543
No, I know.

1617
01:55:34,052 --> 01:55:35,253
But he can.

1618
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:40,850
No.

1619
01:55:48,733 --> 01:55:52,233
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1620
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:54,607
I am your reckoning!

1621
01:56:03,915 --> 01:56:05,537
The people are safe.

1622
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:07,957
That's all that matters.

1623
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:11,311
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1624
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:13,083
I hate this prophecy.

1625
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:15,048
So do I, but we have no choice.

1626
01:56:15,135 --> 01:56:17,008
Surtur destroys Asgard...

1627
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:19,430
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1628
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:21,098
But we need to let him finish the job,

1629
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:22,499
otherwise...

1630
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:25,136
No!

1631
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:29,482
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1632
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:39,739
Hulk, stop.

1633
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:42,829
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1634
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:45,790
Big monster!

1635
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:47,333
Let's go!

1636
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:50,203
Fine.

1637
01:57:14,194 --> 01:57:17,068
I am Asgard's doom!

1638
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:42,221
The damage is not too bad.

1639
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:44,382
As long as the foundations
are still strong...

1640
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:46,017
we can rebuild this place.

1641
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:48,562
It will become a haven...

1642
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:51,564
for all peoples and aliens of the universe.

1643
01:57:58,405 --> 01:58:00,949
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1644
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,962
What have I done?

1645
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:21,548
You saved us from extinction.

1646
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:23,429
Asgard is not a place...

1647
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:26,762
it's a people.

1648
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:57,501
It suits you.

1649
01:59:00,175 --> 01:59:02,719
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

1650
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:04,216
Maybe not.

1651
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:06,719
Thank you.

1652
01:59:07,432 --> 01:59:09,805
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1653
01:59:14,105 --> 01:59:15,477
I'm here.

1654
01:59:39,506 --> 01:59:40,958
Your throne.

1655
01:59:56,064 --> 01:59:59,188
So. King of Asgard.

1656
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:10,862
Where to?

1657
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:13,365
I'm not sure.

1658
02:00:13,915 --> 02:00:15,207
Any suggestions?

1659
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:19,795
Miek, where are you from?

1660
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:21,961
Miek's dead.

1661
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:25,217
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

1662
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:28,008
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.

1663
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:31,974
Miek, you're alive!

1664
02:00:31,975 --> 02:00:33,225
He's alive, guys.

1665
02:00:33,226 --> 02:00:34,787
What was your question again, bro?

1666
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:37,430
Earth it is.

1667
02:02:53,992 --> 02:02:55,492
Do you really think it's a good idea

1668
02:02:55,493 --> 02:02:56,785
to go back to Earth?

1669
02:02:57,161 --> 02:02:58,245
Yes, of course.

1670
02:02:58,246 --> 02:03:00,540
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

1671
02:03:00,874 --> 02:03:02,872
Let me rephrase that.

1672
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:04,918
Do you really think it's a good idea

1673
02:03:04,919 --> 02:03:06,496
to bring me back to Earth?

1674
02:03:06,963 --> 02:03:09,006
Probably not, to be honest.

1675
02:03:09,007 --> 02:03:10,799
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1676
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:14,004
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

1677
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:44,101
Boy.

1678
02:09:52,285 --> 02:09:56,490
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

1679
02:09:56,706 --> 02:10:00,126
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

1680
02:10:00,293 --> 02:10:02,752
Pat on the back. Pat on the back.

1681
02:10:02,753 --> 02:10:05,206
Come on. No?

1682
02:10:05,548 --> 02:10:07,632
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.

1683
02:10:07,633 --> 02:10:10,510
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

1684
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:12,588
So, you're welcome.

1685
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:15,133
And, it's a tie.
